# Why mobx-value born ?

## The complexity from Redux and Vuex

React And Vue end up the jquery times.

After that, data management become a new heavy and hard work.

Redux and Vuex came out to solve it.

But they all bring more code layers

Is there some better tool can do the same work like redux, and can hide the complexity?

After many project and compared with many tools such as redux, immutable, redux-saga, vuex, context + hooks, recoil, one day I enter the mobx ecosystem.

They all could solve data problem, and also increased the burden of thinking.

In real world, data management is never easy, but I hope a tool can hide the hard logic and provide as simple as possible api for developers.

Finally, mobx-value born ðŸŽ‰
