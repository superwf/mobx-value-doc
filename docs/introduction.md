# Why mobx-value born ?

## The complexity from Redux and Vuex

React And Vue end up the jquery times.

After that, data management become a new heavy and hard work.

Redux and Vuex came out to solve it.

But they all bring more code layer, and blocked my mind a lot.

Is there some better tool can do the same work like redux, and can hide the complexity?

After many project and compared with many tools such as redux, redux-saga, vuex, context + hooks, recoil ...

Yes, data management is never easy, but I hope a tool can hide hard part and provide light api for developer.

Finally, I made this one.
